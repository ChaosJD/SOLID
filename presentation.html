# Open Closed Principle(OCP)

should be open for extension, but closed for modification that is, such
an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source
code. The name open/closed principle has been used in two ways. Both ways use
generalizations (for instance, inheritance or delegate functions) to resolve
the apparent dilemma, but the goals, techniques, and results are different.

## Meyer's Principle

* A module will be said to be open if it is still available for extension. For
example, it should be possible to add fields to the data structures it contains,
or new elements to the set of functions it performs.
* A module will be said to be closed if [it] is available for use by other
modules. This assumes that the module has been given a well-defined, stable
description (the interface in the sense of information hiding).
* A class is closed, since it may be compiled, stored in a library, baselined
 and used by client classes. But it is also open, since any new class may use
 it as parent, adding new features. When a descendant class is defined, there
  is no need to change the original or to disturb its clients

## Today - Protected Variations
In contrast to Meyer's usage, this definition advocates inheritance from
abstract base classes. Interface specifications can be reused through
inheritance but implementation need not be. The existing interface is closed
to modifications and new implementations must, at a minimum, implement that
interface.

# Liskov Substitution Principle - Principle Of Substitutability, Part1

# Liskov Substitution Principle - Principle Of Substitutability, Part2


It states that a program that uses objects of a base class T must also
function correctly with objects of the derived class S without changing the
program.
With regard to individual methods, the Liskov substitution principle means that
when a method is overwritten by a derived class, the prerequisites required by
the base class for the overwritten method may only be weakened by the
overwriting and the subsequent conditions guaranteed by the base class for the
overwritten method may only be strengthened by the overwriting.

---
# Interface Segregation Prinzip

Accordingly, interfaces that are too large should be divided into several interfaces
if implementing classes need to have unnecessary methods. After
successful application of this design principle, a module which includes a
interface, implement only those methods that use it.

# Dependency Inversion Principle - DIP

##### Bad Example
```
public class Lampe {
   private boolean leuchtet;

   public void anschalten() {
      leuchtet = true;
   }

   public void ausschalten() {
      leuchtet = false;
   }
}

public class Schalter {
   private Lampe lampe;
   private boolean gedrueckt;

   public Schalter(Lampe lampe) {
      this.lampe = lampe;
   }

   public void drueckeSchalter() {
      gedrueckt = !gedrueckt;
      if(gedrueckt) {
         lampe.anschalten();
      } else {
         lampe.ausschalten();
      }
   }
}
```

---

# The Problem
Switch controls the course of the behavior and uses lamp for it.
Therefore it should belong to a higher level module. However, the described
model violates the DIP, since switch is dependent on lamp. If it is decided
that the methods will be renamed from lamp, switches must also be changed.

The basic problem is that switches work directly with lamp, which belongs to a
lower module. Switch should define how the object it works with should look.

# The Solution ->

---

```
public interface SchalterClient {
   public void anschalten();
   public void ausschalten();
}

public class Lampe implements SchalterClient {
   private boolean leuchtet;

   public void anschalten() {
      leuchtet = true;
   }

   public void ausschalten() {
      leuchtet = false;
   }
}

public class Schalter {
   private SchalterClient client;
   private boolean gedrueckt;

   public Schalter(Schalterclient client) {
      this.client = client;
   }

   public void drueckeSchalter() {
      gedrueckt = !gedrueckt;
      if(gedrueckt) {
         client.anschalten();
      } else {
         client.ausschalten();
      }
   }
}
```
